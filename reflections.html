								<h1> Business Design </h1>
								<h3> Reflections </h3>
								<p> Of mindmaps and humble beginnings... </p>

								<p> I remember sitting in this same spot as I wrote my first ever reflection for this class. That day I learnt three very important things:
								<ul>
									<li> In the last 20 years, I had never been asked to think about my thinking process </li>
									<li> Mind Maps are really useful tools </li>
									<li> I am a very critical thinker with a highly convergent way of thinking </li>
								</ul>
								Now the first one might be surprising and the second one intuitive, it was the last observation that actually set the tone for the rest of my class experience. You see, I knew I was a critical thinker but it was only through self introspection did I realise how behind that label lied all the mental models I had adopted throughout my life. </p>

								<p>Once I had a deeper understanding of who I was, it was easier to understand how I thought. The business dictionary defines mental models as “beliefs, ideas, images, and verbal descriptions that we consciously or unconsciously form from our experiences and which (when formed) guide our thoughts and actions within narrow channels.” I realized that the way I thought was defined by what mental models I had adopted growing up. Growing up in an Asian household, a great emphasis was placed on logically solving problems. Each problem had an ordered set of steps - identification stage, research, one best solution. Once I look at the bigger picture and my role within it, I try to establish a problem statement, conduct my research on the internet, on papers and cases that could give me more insight into the problem, and then come up with an optimal solution. Growing up in that setting, I subconsciously adopted these steps towards every problem I had in my life - from professional to personal - giving me a very convergent way of thinking. The problem with this form of thinking was that it inhibited creativity and forced me to view problems on an opposing spectrum that did not account for integrative solutions.</p>
								<p>In University, I had the opportunity to participate in certain courses and hackathons that expanded the way I thought and allowed me to understand the principles of integrative thinking. I realized that problems, more often than not, do not have a single simple solution. While my current process of thinking is sound and structured, it lacks substance. I realized after taking this course that to find solutions to these wicked problems, one needs to empathize with the motivations and emotions behind the problem and allow for more human-centric solutions. I also realized that a well-designed solution does not merely cater to novel functionality, but also supports good form and fit. I used to work at Apple and thinking back, I realize how they are changing their business models to move away from being a product-oriented company to a company that inspires emotions and skills i.e. instead of focussing on novel updates to their iPhones, they are spending considerable funding in promoting community-based learning at Today at Apple. These insights on my reflection make me very excited to continue with this course since I firmly believe it would allow me to challenge my existing mental models, develop a more divergent way of thinking as well as understand the principles behind good business design. I made a brief video explaining the way I think in hackathons currently. The last stage in my thinking process is creating a road map to achieve the desired solution, however I wish to learn how to continue innovating this road map in order to create more sustainable and empathetic solutions to the problems facing the world.
