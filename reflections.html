                                <h1> How can design thinking change your entire life in a matter of 12 weeks?</h1>
                                <h2> A look back into my latest business design sprint </h2>
                                <hr> 
                                <img src="./images/qr code.png" width="850" height="500">
                                <hr>
                                <h3> Of mind maps and humble beginnings..</h3>
                                <img src="./images/reflection_before.png" width="850" height="500">
								<p style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> I remember sitting in this same spot as I wrote my first ever reflection for this class. That day I learnt three very important things: </p>
								<ul>
                                    <li>In the last 20 years, I had never been asked to think about my thinking process</li>
                                    <li> Mind Maps are really useful tools </li>
                                    <li style="color: red">I am a very critical thinker </li>
                                </ul>
								<p>Now the first one might be surprising and the second one intuitive, it was the last observation that actually set the tone for the rest of my experience. You see, I knew I was a convergent thinker but it was only through self introspection did I acknowledge all the mental models I had adopted throughout my life.</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>The break in the case...</h3>
								
								<p> Needless to say, the course seemed quite challenging up to that point. I think my first real interaction with a learning insight came from the <span style="color: red;"> Ten Faces of Innovation</span>. Whenever someone said innovation, I would think of an innovative digital breakthrough; it was intriguing to learn how innovation is all about the people - the roles they play, the knowledge they bring and the personas they can adopt.</p>
                                <img src="./images/annoying_avani.png" width="850" height="500">
                                <img src="./images/the five.png" width="850" height="400">
                                <p> I remember this class very well since it forced me to think about not just who I am but who I want to be. I am a critical thinker but does that stop me from being a storyteller or a cross-pollinator? How could I evolve into one or more of these faces of innovation?</p>
                                <hr> 
                                <img src="./images/rbc.png" width="850" height="400">
                                <h2 align=center style="color: red; margin-right: 6cm;">“How will we solve a wicked problem like a housing challenge?!?!?!”</h2>
                                <p>RBC’s question was simple but the answer to that question from the lens of user centered approach was quite complex.</p>
                                <h3> Lean Ethnography, Interviews and Data Sorting... </h3>
                                <p style="margin-right: 6cm;"> My second key discoveries in the course were through the real time data research experience which taught me three things: </p>
                                <ul style="margin-right: 6cm;">
                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75cm;"> Observing random strangers for an extended period of time could get <span style="color: red;">very frustrating</span> but once I started observing with a fresh pair of eyes and through POEMS, I gained insights I would have missed otherwise. Ex. Observing at the Graduate Students’ Union pub, I was challenged in my notion that students are often careless with their money while drinking. I actually witnessed multiple students carefully taking out cash and coins and deliberating for a while before ordering the cheapest beer, leading me to believe that my confirmation bias was blocking my insights. </li>
                                    <img src="./images/question.png" alt="source credit: Advika Shukla and Team 5" width="850" height="300">
                                    <li style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> There is a difference between a problem and a need: Need highlights a pain point and can bring a human perspective to solving problems. Active observation helps us with understanding people’s work, family, beliefs and habits which allow us to find the human need.</li>
                                    <li> Data Sorting is the process where it all makes sense for a brief moment, especially as my team got deeper insights into the emotional and functional reasons behind an average UTSG undergraduates’ habits and behaviors. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <img src="./images/data_sorting.png" width="1050" height="700">
                                <h3> Feedback loops are everything… and I mean, everything… </h3>
                                <p> Feedback loops are a constant stage of monitoring and testing. As a coder, this process of reiteration was probably the one I was most familiar with in the entire course but I really enjoyed seeing it come to live in context of a business design problem.</p>
