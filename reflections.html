                                <h1 style="margin-right: 6cm;"> How design thinking changed my life in 12 weeks</h1>
                                <h2> A look back into my latest business design sprint </h2>
                                <hr> 
                                <img src="./images/qr code.png" width="850" height="500">
                                <hr>
                                <h3> Of mind maps and humble beginnings..</h3>
                                <img src="./images/reflection_before.png" width="850" height="700">
								<p style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> I remember sitting in this same spot as I wrote my first ever reflection for this class. That day I learnt three very important things: </p>
								<ul>
                                    <li>In the last 20 years, I had never been asked to think about my thinking process</li>
                                    <li> Mind Maps are really useful tools </li>
                                    <li style="color: red">I am a very critical thinker </li>
                                </ul>
								<p>Now the first one might be surprising and the second one intuitive, it was the last observation that actually set the tone for the rest of my experience.</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>The break in the case...</h3>
								
								<p> Needless to say, the course seemed quite challenging. My first learning insight came from the <span style="color: red;"> Ten Faces of Innovation</span>. Whenever someone said innovation, I would think of an innovative digital breakthrough; it was intriguing to learn how innovation is all about the people - the roles they play, the knowledge they bring and the personas they can adopt.</p>

                                <img src="./images/the five.png" width="850" height="400">
                                <p> I remember this class very well since it forced me to think about not just who I am but who I want to be. I am a critical thinker but does that stop me from being a storyteller or a cross-pollinator? How could I evolve into one or more of these faces of innovation?</p>
                                <hr>

                                <h2 align=center style="color: red; margin-right: 6cm;">“How will we solve a wicked problem like a housing challenge?!?!?!”</h2>
                                <p>RBC’s question was simple but the answer to that question from the lens of user centered approach was complex.</p>
                                <h3> Lean Ethnography, Interviews and Data Sorting... </h3>
                                <p style="margin-right: 6cm;"> My second discovery in the course was through real time data research experience which taught me: </p>
                                <ul style="margin-right: 6cm;">
                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75cm;"> Observing random strangers for an extended period of time is <span style="color: red;">very frustrating</span> but once I started observing through POEMS, I gained insights I would have missed otherwise. Ex. Observing at the Graduate Students’ Union pub, I was challenged in my notion that students are often careless with their money while drinking. I actually witnessed multiple students carefully taking out cash and coins and deliberating for a while before ordering the cheapest beer, leading me to believe that my confirmation bias was blocking my insights. </li>

                                    <img src="./images/question.png" alt="source credit: Advika Shukla and Team 5" width="850" height="300">
                                    <li style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> There is a difference between a problem and a need: <span style="color: red;">Needs highlight a pain point. </span>  Active observation help us reframe the problem to understand these human needs. Ex. “a slow elevator” versus “long wait times at the elevator” seem similar but are addressing different pain points and ignoring that prevents us from implementing the most optimal solution. </li>
                                    <li style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> Data Sorting is the process where it all makes sense for a brief moment, especially as my team got insights into the emotional and functional reasons behind UTSG undergraduates’ habits and behaviors. We started with <span style="color: red;">sticky notes</span>, used <span style="color: red;"> empathy maps, graphs, personas</span> and <span style="color: red;"> some more sticky notes</span>. This is what stuck:</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Feedback loops are everything… and I mean, everything… </h3>
                                <p> Feedback loops are a constant stage of monitoring and testing. As a coder, this process of reiteration was probably one I was most familiar with in the entire course and I really enjoyed seeing it come to life in context of business design.</p>

                                <h3> So where does that bring us…</h3> 
                                <p> This brings us all the way to my favorite class: Rapid Prototyping and Storytelling. Throughout the course I found my way of convergent thinking challenged multiple times, but I tried to stick it out in my (un)comfort zone. From roleplay to storyboards, prototyping is about testing ideas and creative freedom. We used “HOUSE-OPOLY” for inspiration: when users view homebuying as a game with the prize of owning your own home --- whether it means freedom of expression or an investment, that changes how users can incentivized to learn proactively.</p>

                                <h3> How did one class in my last year of university change me?</h3>
                                <img src="./images/linkedIn.png" width="850" height="500">
                                <p> Well, I am no longer just a critical thinker. I find myself applying the theories of design thinking and storytelling to both person and professional projects. I have started observing situations more objectively which has arguably made me a better data collector but at the same time I have learnt how to use data sorting tools to find human centered insights. It is rare to find a class that affects one's manner of thinking so greatly, so as I sit here introspecting on my first ever design sprint, I must say it has been an experience to share and remember.</p>
