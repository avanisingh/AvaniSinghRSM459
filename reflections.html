                                <h1> How can design thinking change your entire life in a matter of 12 weeks?</h1>
                                <h2> A look back into my latest business design sprint </h2>
                                <hr> 
                                <img src="./images/qr code.png" width="850" height="500">
                                <hr>
                                <h3> Of mind maps and humble beginnings..</h3>
                                <img src="./images/reflection_before.png" width="850" height="700">
								<p style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> I remember sitting in this same spot as I wrote my first ever reflection for this class. That day I learnt three very important things: </p>
								<ul>
                                    <li>In the last 20 years, I had never been asked to think about my thinking process</li>
                                    <li> Mind Maps are really useful tools </li>
                                    <li style="color: red">I am a very critical thinker </li>
                                </ul>
								<p>Now the first one might be surprising and the second one intuitive, it was the last observation that actually set the tone for the rest of my experience. You see, I knew I was a convergent thinker but it was only through self introspection did I acknowledge all the mental models I had adopted throughout my life.</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>The break in the case...</h3>
								
								<p> Needless to say, the course seemed quite challenging up to that point. I think my first real interaction with a learning insight came from the <span style="color: red;"> Ten Faces of Innovation</span>. Whenever someone said innovation, I would think of an innovative digital breakthrough; it was intriguing to learn how innovation is all about the people - the roles they play, the knowledge they bring and the personas they can adopt.</p>

                                <img src="./images/the five.png" width="850" height="400">
                                <p> I remember this class very well since it forced me to think about not just who I am but who I want to be. I am a critical thinker but does that stop me from being a storyteller or a cross-pollinator? How could I evolve into one or more of these faces of innovation?</p>

                                <h2 align=center style="color: red; margin-right: 6cm;">“How will we solve a wicked problem like a housing challenge?!?!?!”</h2>
                                <p>RBC’s question was simple but the answer to that question from the lens of user centered approach was quite complex.</p>
                                <h3> Lean Ethnography, Interviews and Data Sorting... </h3>
                                <p style="margin-right: 6cm;"> My second key discoveries in the course were through the real time data research experience which taught me three things: </p>
                                <ul style="margin-right: 6cm;">
                                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75cm;"> Observing random strangers for an extended period of time could get <span style="color: red;">very frustrating</span> but once I started observing with a fresh pair of eyes and through POEMS, I gained insights I would have missed otherwise. Ex. Observing at the Graduate Students’ Union pub, I was challenged in my notion that students are often careless with their money while drinking. I actually witnessed multiple students carefully taking out cash and coins and deliberating for a while before ordering the cheapest beer, leading me to believe that my confirmation bias was blocking my insights. </li>

                                    <img src="./images/question.png" alt="source credit: Advika Shukla and Team 5" width="850" height="300">
                                    <li style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> There is a difference between a problem and a need: <span style="color: red;">Needs highlight a pain point. </span>  Active observation and metaphors help us with reframing the problem to understand these human needs. Ex. “a slow elevator” versus “long wait times at the elevator” seem similar but are addressing different human pain points and ignoring that prevents us from implementing the most optimal solution. </li>
                                    <li style="margin-top: 0.75cm;"> Data Sorting is the process where it all makes sense for a brief moment, especially as my team got deeper insights into the emotional and functional reasons behind an average UTSG undergraduates’ habits and behaviors. We started with <span style="color: red;">sticky notes</span>, used <span style="color: red;"> empathy maps, graphs, personas</span> and <span style="color: red;"> some more sticky notes</span>. This is what stuck:</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0.5cm;"> source credit: team 5</p>

                                <h3> Feedback loops are everything… and I mean, everything… </h3>
                                <p> Feedback loops are a constant stage of monitoring and testing. As a coder, this process of reiteration was probably the one I was most familiar with in the entire course but I really enjoyed seeing it come to live in context of a business design problem.</p>

                                <h3> So where does that bring us…</h3> 
                                <p> This brings us all the way to the last class and my favorite one: Rapid Prototyping and Storytelling. Throughout the course I found my way of convergent thinking challenged multiple times, but I tried to stick it out in my (un)comfort zone. From roleplay to storyboards, this class was all about testing ideas and creative freedom. We came up with ridiculous ideas that evolved into viable prototypes. We used “HOUSE-OPOLY” as our inspiration: when you motivate users to view house buying as a game with the prize of owning your own home --- whether it means freedom of expression or an investment to you, that changes how we can incentivize users to learn proactively.</p>

                                <h3> So how did one class in my second last semester of university change me?</h3>
                                <img src="./images/linkedIn.png" width="850" height="500">
                                <p> Well, I am no longer just a critical thinker. I find myself applying the theories of design thinking and storytelling to every project I conduct in my life, whether personal or professional. I have started observing situations more objectively which has arguably made me a better data collector and more detail oriented but at the same time I have learnt how to use various data sorting tools to find human centered insights. Understanding how to place human relationships in strategic business decision is a skillset I have already started employing at my work as an executive at the student union. I enjoy university but it is rare that you ever find a class that affects your manner of thinking so greatly, so as I sit here introspecting on my first ever design sprint, I must here it has definitely been an experience to share and remember.</p>
