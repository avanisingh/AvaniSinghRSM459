								<h1> Thinking about thinking</h1>
								<h3> a meta reflection into why i think the way i think </h3>
								<p> How do I think? As I sat there thinking about thinking, my mind was completely blank. I know there had to be a reason why I choose the paths I choose, make the decisions I make, and think the way I do. But what was that reason? Finally, with a certain degree of frustration, I did the only thing a business design student could do: I started working on a mind map of who I am. It was quite a difficult exercise, all things considered, and I had to think about how I would define myself on a piece of paper. It generated the following result:</p>

								<hr>
								<p>I used the mind map to chart my background identity, my interests and hobbies, my personality traits, as well as other events that shaped the way I thought. It was interesting because I noticed that I could apply the learnings from the first business design class to this mind map. I was able to break down assumptions I had about myself into smaller blocks of facts in order to find where these assumptions arose from. For example, I believe I am a risk taker. Now, where did this assumption come from? Reflecting on it, I realized that I have often participated in extremely risky adrenaline based activities like walking with a tiger and deep-diving with my father on our frequent travels. It was interesting to see how different aspects of my mind map came together as a web to make me who I am today. It also made me realise that this was the first stage of my thinking process. When put in situations where I don’t know what to do, I often take a step back and look at the big picture. I observe, ask questions to perceive and collect data and try to find inferences from the observations. While this can be useful in many situations, it does create delays in action and increases barriers to finding the actual problem.</p>

								<p>Once I had a deeper understanding of who I was, it was easier to understand how I thought. The business dictionary defines mental models as “beliefs, ideas, images, and verbal descriptions that we consciously or unconsciously form from our experiences and which (when formed) guide our thoughts and actions within narrow channels.” I realized that the way I thought was defined by what mental models I had adopted growing up. Growing up in an Asian household, a great emphasis was placed on logically solving problems. Each problem had an ordered set of steps - identification stage, research, one best solution. Once I look at the bigger picture and my role within it, I try to establish a problem statement, conduct my research on the internet, on papers and cases that could give me more insight into the problem, and then come up with an optimal solution. Growing up in that setting, I subconsciously adopted these steps towards every problem I had in my life - from professional to personal - giving me a very convergent way of thinking. The problem with this form of thinking was that it inhibited creativity and forced me to view problems on an opposing spectrum that did not account for integrative solutions.</p>
								<p>In University, I had the opportunity to participate in certain courses and hackathons that expanded the way I thought and allowed me to understand the principles of integrative thinking. I realized that problems, more often than not, do not have a single simple solution. While my current process of thinking is sound and structured, it lack substance. I realized after taking this course that to find solutions to these wicked problems, one needs to empathize with the motivations and emotions behind the problem and allow for more human-centric solutions. I also realized that a well-designed solution does not merely cater to novel functionality, but also supports good form and fit. I used to work at Apple and thinking back, I realize how they are changing their business models to move away from being a product-oriented company to a company that inspires emotions and skills i.e. instead of focussing on novel updates to their iPhones, they are spending considerable funding in promoting community-based learning at Today at Apple. These insights on my reflection make me very excited to continue with this course since I firmly believe it would allow me to challenge my existing mental models, develop a more divergent way of thinking as well as understand the principles behind good business design. I made a brief video explaining the way I think in hackathons currently. The last stage in my thinking process is creating a road map to achieve the desired solution, however I would learn how to continue innovating this road map in order to create more sustainable and empathetic solutions to problems.
