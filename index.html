								<h1> Thinking about thinking</h1>
								<h3> a meta reflection into why i think the way i think </h3>
								<p> How do I think? As I sat there thinking about thinking, my mind was completely blank. I know there had to be a reason why I choose the paths I choose, make the decisions I make, and think the way I do. But what was that reason? Finally, with a certain degree of frustration, I did the only thing a business design student could do: I started working on a mind map of who I am. It was quite a difficult exercise, all things considered, and I had to think about how I would define myself on a piece of paper. It generated the following result:</p>

								<hr>
								<p>I used the mind map to chart my background identity, my interests and hobbies, my personality traits, as well as other events that acted as potential mental models to how I thought. It was interesting because I noticed that I could apply the teachings of the first business design class to this mind map. I kept breaking assumptions that I had about myself into smaller blocks to find where these assumptions arose from. This allowed me to reach a state of pure fact. For example, I believe I am a Risk Taker. Now, where did this assumption come from? Reflecting on it, I realized that I have often participated in extremely risky adrenaline based activities like walking with a tiger and deep-diving since I had the opportunity to frequently travel with my dad growing up. It was interesting to see how different aspects of my mind map came together as a web to make me who I am today. This was also the first stage of my thinking process. When put in a situation where I didn’t know what to do, I would often take a step back and look at the big picture. I would observe, ask questions to perceive and collect data. While this can be useful in many situations, it does create delays in action and increase barriers to finding the actual problem.</p>

								<p>Once I had a deeper understanding of who I was, it was easier to understand how I thought. The business dictionary defines mental models as “beliefs, ideas, images, and verbal descriptions that we consciously or unconsciously form from our experiences and which (when formed) guide our thoughts and actions within narrow channels.” I realized that the way I thought was greatly defined by what mental models I had adopted growing up. Growing up in an Asian household, a great emphasis was placed on logically solving problems. Each problem had a set of steps - identification stage, research, one solution, a roadmap of activities, clarification and updates. Growing up in that setting, I subconsciously adopted these set of steps towards every problem I had in my life - from professional to personal - giving me a very convergent way of thinking. </p>
